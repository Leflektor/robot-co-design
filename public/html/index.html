                    <h3>
                        The goal of this project is to implement an internet
                        site to assist in the co-creation of medical robots,
                        primarily aimed at helping older adults but also
                        benefiting individuals with various illnesses who need
                        such assistance from robots. The implemented site should
                        facilitate the co-creation process in such a way that
                        even a person completely inexperienced with robots or
                        technology can understand why certain features would be
                        helpful for them. We aim to achieve this utility by
                        providing a site with many well-explained pictures and a
                        questionnaire that will help users design a robot
                        perfectly suited to their needs.
