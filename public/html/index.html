                            The goal of this project is to implement an internet
                            site to assist in the co-creation of medical robots,
                            primarily aimed at helping older adults but also
                            benefiting individuals with various illnesses who
                            need such assistance from robots. The implemented
                            site should facilitate the co-creation process in
                            such a way that even a person completely
                            inexperienced with robots or technology can
                            understand why certain features would be helpful for
                            them. We aim to achieve this utility by providing a
                            site with many well-explained pictures and a
                            questionnaire that will help users design a robot
                            perfectly suited to their needs.
